				<p id="postContentBody">Whenever is possible you should get some rest throughout the day. Take advantage of the baby's naps and join him/her to get some much needed sleep. If you have to dismiss the kitchen for a while or if the laundry pile is not getting addressed for today it's okay. There are priorities in life and the biggest should be to get an healthy family dynamic where everyone is taken into account and cared for.</p>
